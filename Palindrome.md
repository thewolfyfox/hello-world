**Identifying palindromes** 

To identify a plaindrome, you check the first and last letter, and see if they are the same. Next you check the 2nd and 2nd last letter, and see if they are the same.
You repeat this until there are no letters left, or if there is just 1 letter left and none to compare it to.
