*Cybersecurity - protects the secrecy, integrity and availability of computer systems and data against threas
    ***Integrity** : Only authorized people should have ability to use or modify systems and data
     * e.g. a hacker sending emails mascarading as you is an integrity attack
    ***Availability** : An availability attack means that authorized people should have access to theiy systems and data
      *e.g. A DoS (denial of service) attack overloads a website with fake requests to make it slow or unreachable for others
  ***Secrecy/confidentiality** : Only authorized people should be able to access/read specific computer systems or data
      *e.g. a breach in privacy when personal details are leaked is an attack on secrecy/confidentiality
     
*Computers have no ethics - will execute any valid instruction!

*Security experts start by profiling attackers with something called a **threat model**
    *Specifies their capabilities, goals and probabal means of attack.

***Authentication** used to differentiate between "right" and "wrong" people:
    *There are 3 types:
        ***"What you know"** : Based off knowledgde that should only be known by the right user and the computer. e.g. username + password
            *Most common, as easiest to compliment. 
            *However can be compromised, if hacker gets access to your "secret".
            *e.g. computers can test all 4 digit numbers in a fraction of a second, called a **brute force attack**.
            *Way to overcome : block attempts after 3 wrong attempts, or making sure lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numbers and special symbols are used.
        ***"What you have**" : based on the possession of a secret token only the real user has.
            *e.g. physical key and lock. 
            *Way to overcome : can be compromised if there is a physical presence of the attacker, e.g. a key is stolen or copied.
        ***"What you are"** -  Authenticate by presenting yourself to the computer, e.g. biometrics.
            *Way to overcome : might re
